# Distributed Word Count
This repository contains code that inḿplements a distributed [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) algorithm to count words in a text. The implementation uses the
[ZeroMQ library](https://zeromq.org/) to communicate between the *distributor* and the *workers*.
